# My mclip program

One of the example programs from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". 

It copies a pre-defined text to the clipboard using the "Run" command on windows.
For example:
  - click win + r (to open the "Run" command in windows)
  - type mclip [key] (Where the key points to a pre-defined text)

*The mclip.bat file has to be saved in the C:\Windows folder and the py.exe line within has to point to the actual path to the mclip.py file*
